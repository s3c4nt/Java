# Java
The code in this repo comes from two tutorials designed to teach data
 structures via java. The purpose of this repo is to help me keep track
of my progress in these tutorials.

These tutorials come from Stanford's Programming Methodology course taught
 by Mehran Sahami. Available through itunesU or Stanford's website.

The rest of the coding tutorials come from Data Structures and Software
 Development in an object-oriented domain by Tremblay and Cheston.
